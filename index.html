    <h1>Question & Answer</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What does computer science represent for you?</h2>
    <p>Well, computer science is a true calling for me. I have always been interested in this field. 
        It all began when I was twelve, exploring the possibilities on my rooted Android tablet. 
        This allowed me to have complete control over my device but, more importantly, 
        to understand a part of the underlying software architecture of the Android operating system - 
        it was a real pleasure for me. Today, I am thrilled to study what I love most: 
        computer science, and more specifically networks (with cybersecurity coming up soon).
